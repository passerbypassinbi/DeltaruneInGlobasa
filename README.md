Chapter 4:

To Do:

- [ ] Make prettier README

- [X] Figure out proper way to package changes into one easy-to-use package (Perhaps using existing work from the [Chinese fanlation](https://github.com/gm3dr/DeltaruneChinesePatcher) or the [Italian one](https://github.com/USPAssets/Installer))
- [X] Figure out if it's possible to cleanly extract something similar to lang_en.json from Chapters 2-4, because [UndertaleModTool](https://github.com/UnderminersTeam/UndertaleModTool) doesn't seem to offer the most... elegant solution...
  - [ ] Use [Detranslate](https://neprim.itch.io/deltranslate-project) instead once updated for Chapters 3 & 4
